## Encryptify
This project is a C++ implementation of an Encryptor/Decryptor using low-level memory management techniques. 
It leverages unique pointers for safe and efficient memory handling. Tasks, defined by a custom data type, are stored in a queue and executed sequentially to perform encryption or decryption.


# Features:
1. Encryption and decryption of data using a custom algorithm.
2. Use of unique pointers for efficient memory management.
3. Task management system using a queue for sequential processing.
4. Integration with external libraries for enhanced functionality.

# Installation:
1. ''' git clone https://github.com/suryansh-2003/Encryptify.git
   '''
3. ''' cd Encryptify '''
